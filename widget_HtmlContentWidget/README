Released under the BSD license. 

A simple widget to add HTML content to the sidebar.

INSTALLATION:
Extract this to your SilverStripe root directory and run "db/build".

USAGE:
In the CMS visit a page with enabled widget sidebar and drag and drop the "HTML Content" box to the right.

PLEASE NOTE: If the text editor field of the Widget (content) is not visible, save and reload the page. This usually happens when you drag the widget onto a page for the first time.
If you know how to fix this please drop me a line.
